# 🛡️ Thermal Ninja - Smart Thermal Monitoring and Analysis Suite



## 🚀 Overview

**Thermal Ninja** is a lightweight, background-running desktop utility designed to **monitor**, **analyze**, and **optimize** your computer’s thermal performance in real-time.

It tracks your system's temperatures, learns your usage patterns, and provides **smart suggestions** — all through **non-intrusive local PC notifications**.

> **Note:** No email/SMS alerts. Only secure, fast, on-device notifications.



## 🎯 Core Objectives

- 🖥️ **Background Monitoring**: Silent background thermal monitoring.
- 🌡️ **Live Thermal Status**: Real-time CPU, GPU, motherboard, and storage temperatures.
- 📈 **Usage Pattern Analysis**: Learns and calibrates based on user behavior.
- 📊 **Odometer-Style Dashboard**: Live thermal stats visualization.
- 🔔 **Smart Alerts**: Actionable PC notifications.
- 🧠 **Behavioral Learning**: Adapts to user’s workload habits.
- 🛡️ **Dead Man’s Switch** (optional future): Emergency shutdown on critical overheating.


## 🛠️ Planned Features

| Feature | Status | Priority |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Background Monitoring | ✅ | High |
| Local PC Notifications | ✅ | High |
| Odometer-Style Live UI | 🔜 | High |
| Adaptive Thermal Thresholds | 🔜 | High |
| Smart Cooling Suggestions | 🔜 | Medium |
| Auto-Start on Boot | 🔜 | Medium |
| Dead Man’s Switch (Critical Shutdown) | 🧠 (Idea Stage) | Optional |
| Historical Usage Graphs | 🔜 | Bonus |


## 📋 How It Works

1. **Startup**: Launches manually or automatically.
2. **Thermal Tracking**: Monitors temperatures 24/7.
3. **Calibration Phase**: Learns user’s normal and heavy usage cycles.
4. **Active Alerting**: Immediate PC notifications for abnormal behavior.
5. **Suggestion Engine**: Recommends actions based on system analysis.
6. **Dashboard View**: (Optional) Odometer-themed real-time stats.

## 📦 Tech Stack

- **Python** (primary development language)
- **Tkinter / CustomTkinter** (for UI dashboard)
- **psutil**, **py-cpuinfo**, **platform** (for system metrics)
- **plyer** (for PC notifications)
- **Matplotlib** (optional for usage graphs)



## 📈 Smart Suggestions Examples

| Condition | Notification |
|:---|:---|
| CPU > 85°C | "⚠️ High CPU Temperature! Close heavy applications or allow cooling." |
| GPU hot during idle | "⚠️ GPU unusually hot while idle. Check background processes." |
| 4+ hours intense usage | "⏳ You've been working for 4+ hours. Consider a short break." |
| Fan failure signs | "⚙️ System fan slowdown detected. Inspect cooling hardware." |



## 🔥 Dead Man’s Switch Concept (Future Plan)

- If CPU exceeds 95°C for >10 seconds and no user activity detected,
- Initiate **safe auto-shutdown** to prevent system damage.
- Configurable threshold settings.
- Designed for critical fail-safety — **not** for regular operations.



## 🧠 Professional Mindset

- 🛡️ **Prevention > Cure**: Intervene before system damage.
- 🔍 **Data Respect**: Monitor, Analyze, Suggest — No data hoarding.
- 📉 **Minimal Footprint**: Lightweight, resource-friendly by design.
- 🧩 **Expandability**: Modular architecture for easy feature upgrades.
- 👁️ **Invisibility Principle**: Remains hidden unless user attention is needed.
